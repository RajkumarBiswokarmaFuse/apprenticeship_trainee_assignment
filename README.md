# Assignment Overview

In this apprenticeship trainee assignment, you will have the opportunity to work on real-world tasks and projects related to your chosen field. The goal of this assignment is to provide you with hands-on experience, practical knowledge, and exposure to the industry.

The topics of assignmengts are:
1. Git
2. Intermediate Python
3. Python Coding Guides
4. Pandas

# Git Overview

Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects while maintaining a history of changes. Here's a basic overview of Git concepts:

    Repository: A repository (repo) is a directory where your project and its version history are stored.

    Commit: A commit represents a snapshot of changes made to the code. Each commit has a unique identifier and a commit message explaining the changes.

    Branch: A branch is a separate line of development. Developers can work on different features or fixes in parallel by creating branches.

    Merge: Merging combines changes from one branch into another, usually to integrate completed work back into the main branch.

# Git Hooks

Git hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository. They let you customize Gitâ€™s internal behavior and trigger customizable actions at key points in the development life cycle.
Example Hook Scenarios :

    Pre-Commit Hook: Enforce code formatting and linting checks before allowing a commit.

    Pre-Push Hook: Run tests and prevent pushing if the tests fail.

    Post-Merge Hook: Automatically install dependencies or perform cleanup tasks after a merge.
